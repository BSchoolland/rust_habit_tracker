# Rust Habit Tracker
This is my first project in rust, which I built as part of a new habit I want to form of making a point of learning new things.  The project integrates a rust program with an SQLite database allowing the user to add and remove habits as well as view which habits have been completed and which still need to be done today.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get some very basic rust experience while still building something useful.  When I started this side project a week ago I knew nothing of rust, but building this has taught me the basic syntax, and avoiding AI forced me to avoid shortcuts in learning.  While it is extremely simple,  I intend to use this project to track habits I want to form.  In essence, this projects was designed to help me grow in my technical as well as personal life.

## Installation
To install this project, you will need to have rust installed on your machine.  You can find instructions on how to do that [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).  Once you have rust installed, you can clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
